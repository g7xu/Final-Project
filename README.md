## Prototype Write-up:
1. So far we have done a lot of exploratory data analysis to understand all the facets of the data from our study and isolate key takeaways we want to communicate to our audience.
Namely, we wish to use data to inform users on the importance of their diet in managing their blood glucose levels, which impacts their wellbeing from moment-to-moment in terms of their energy level, as well as their health in the long-run, such as in predicting the onset of Type II Diabetes.

We then made an outline of the story we wanted to tell based on these findings, and will be working on adding interactive visualizations and polishing them in the next steps.

2. The most challenging part of our project design will be...
